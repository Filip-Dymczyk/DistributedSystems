## Distributed Systems
One of the project elements created for the university class - **Discrete Distributed Dystems**. The main goal is to create a robust communication between multiple devices to perform the given task. 

The main role of this project stage is to:
- read incoming data (weather) through **MQTT protocole** from the prevuious stage,
- store the received data,
- perform necessary calculations,
- send calculated and raw data to the next station.

Implementation will involve the use of **freeRTOS** real-time operating system for proper tasks synchronization. 

Used platform: **Arduino**.
