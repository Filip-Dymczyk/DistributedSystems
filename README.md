## Distributed Systems

This project is part of a university course on **Discrete Distributed Systems**. The main goal is to establish robust communication between multiple devices to accomplish a given task.

### **Project Stage Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project stage are to:
- Read incoming weather data via the **MQTT protocol** from the previous stage.
- Store the received data.
- Perform necessary calculations.
- Send both calculated and raw data to the next station.

The implementation involves the use of the **FreeRTOS** real-time operating system to ensure proper tasks synchronization.

Platform Used: **Arduino**
